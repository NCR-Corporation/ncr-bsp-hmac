Contains a `postman-pre-request-script.js` JavaScript script that can be used in Postman to sign requests with AccessKey authorization (aka HMAC). You use it in your Postman Pre-Request Script tab in your requests.

This repo also contains a Postman collection with two sample calls.

### Getting Started

Import `BSP HMAC Examples.postman_collection.json` into Postman and configure your `shared-key`, `secret-key`, and `nep-organization` Postman environment variables.
